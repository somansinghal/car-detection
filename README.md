# 🚗 Vehicle Detection System

A computer vision–based system that detects vehicles from images and video streams using Python and OpenCV. This project demonstrates real-time object detection concepts commonly used in traffic monitoring and intelligent transportation systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Vehicle Detection System** identifies vehicles such as cars from live video feeds or recorded footage. It uses computer vision techniques to process frames, detect vehicles, and highlight them with bounding boxes.

This project was built to gain hands-on experience in **AI, computer vision, and real-time image processing**.
